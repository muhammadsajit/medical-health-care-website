              <h2>Difference between authorization and authentication</h2>
              <p>Authorization determines what resources a user can access and Authentication verifies who the user is.Authorization works through settings that are implemented and maintained by the organization and Authentication works through passwords, one-time pins, biometric information, and other information provided or entered by the user.Authorization always takes place after authentication and Authentication is the first step of a good identity and access management process.Authorization isn't visible to or changeable by the user and Authentication is visible to and partially changeable by the user.Example: After an employee successfully authenticates, the system determines what information the employees are allowed to access and Example: Employees in a company are required to authenticate through the network before accessing their company email.</p>
